Load-balancing for ISC BIND

BIND supports round-robin DNS, which allows us to distribute load amongst
machines. However, BIND will continue to distribute load to machines even when
those machines are over-loaded or offline.

This package will monitor your services and remove the machines that fail to
reply to requests in time. Currently supported services are:
	LDAP
	ping


Install Instructions

Make sure your machine has BIND, perl, sqlite, and IPC::Lite 

Edit dns-zone-template.txt for your domains nameservers, contacts, TTLs, etc.
{ZONE} and {INTERVAL} will be updated automatically.

Edit load-hosts.txt and add the hosts to monitor, one per line 

Edit load.sh to specify the options:
	--interval=  
		How often to monitor
	--hosts_file= 
		What file has the hosts to monitor
	--zone_file= 
		Where is BIND expecting the zonefile to be
	--zone=  
		The zone to round-robin for
	--bot_file=
		Which monitoring to use
